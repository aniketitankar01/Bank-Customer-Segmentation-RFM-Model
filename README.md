## Introduction
This solution aims to develop a customer segmentation strategy for banking providers, enabling them to divide their customer base into distinct groups based on shared traits such as age, income, values, and lifestyle. The segmentation process enhances customer understanding and facilitates personalized banking services, targeted marketing campaigns, and product recommendations. Ultimately, this approach improves overall customer satisfaction and competitiveness in the market.

## RFM Model Implementation
The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model is utilized to categorize customers into different clusters based on their transaction behavior. The analysis is focused on the top 5 locations: Mumbai, Bangalore, New Delhi, Gurugram, and Delhi.

### Cluster Interpretation

#### Cluster 0: At-Risk/Lapsed Customers
- **Recency**: High (average around 144 days)
- **Frequency**: Low (average around 1 transaction)
- **Monetary**: Low (average around INR 2673)
- *Interpretation*: Customers in this cluster are at risk or lapsed. They haven't made recent purchases, and when they did, they didn't do so frequently or spend much. Engaging them with reactivation campaigns or understanding their reasons for not returning is crucial.

#### Cluster 1: At-Risk/Lapsed Customers
- **Recency**: Very Low (average around 142 days)
- **Frequency**: Very High (average around 1 transaction)
- **Monetary**: Very High (average around INR 180)
- *Interpretation*: Similar to Cluster 0, these customers are at risk or lapsed. Despite high frequency, they haven't made recent purchases or spent significantly. Reactivation strategies are recommended.

#### Cluster 2: Potential Loyalists/Promising Customers
- **Recency**: Moderate (average around 97 days)
- **Frequency**: Moderate (average around 2 transactions)
- **Monetary**: Moderate (average around INR 3116)
- *Interpretation*: Customers in this cluster show potential for loyalty. They exhibit a balanced score across all RFM metrics. Tailored marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and incentives can help increase their value.

#### Cluster 3: Champions/Loyal Customers
- **Recency**: Moderate (average around 1 day)
- **Frequency**: Moderate (average around 1 transaction)
- **Monetary**: Moderate (average around INR 1496)
- *Interpretation*: These are the most valuable customers, frequently making purchases, spending the most, and staying engaged. Maintaining their high engagement level is crucial, and they can be targeted for loyalty rewards and feedback.

## Overall Strategy
- **Clusters 0 & 1 (At-Risk/Lapsed)**: Focus on re-engagement strategies, understand their needs, and offer incentives or feedback surveys to encourage revisits.
- **Cluster 2 (Potential Loyalists/Promising)**: Encourage more frequent purchases through personalized communication and loyalty rewards.
- **Cluster 3 (Champions/Loyal)**: Prioritize maintaining their high level of engagement through exclusive deals, loyalty programs, and early access to new products.

This segmentation approach enables banking providers to tailor their services and marketing efforts according to the distinct needs and behaviors of different customer segments, ultimately enhancing overall customer satisfaction and competitiveness in the market.
